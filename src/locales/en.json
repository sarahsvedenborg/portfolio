    "par2": "When designing the ticks for the checkboxes on this website, I instinctively made them tapering off to the left (as I am used to seeing them in my own handwriting). However, when tweaking the «tail» I realized that they normally face the other way, and was about to change them to conform with traditional UI components.",
    "par3": "But then I thought, WHY? This is my website, and this is one of my quirks. I’m all for not changing what works and am aware of the dangers from getting creative with things people expect to work and certain way. BUT, if I can't get away with displaying a few personal quirks on my own website, then where?"
