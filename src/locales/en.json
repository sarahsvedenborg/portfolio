      "par1": "USEFUL technology is created when users partake in the design process. By interacting with users through interviews, workshops and usability tests, there is no end to the useful insight which can be obtained. These are activities I thoroughly enjoy planning, and especially facilitating. ",
      "par2": "Moreover, I take just as great a pleasure in analyzing the results aftermath, proposing possible solutions and seeing a new product realized."
    },
    "section2": {
      "par1": "It is one thing to design great solutions, it is another to be able to build them. For a long time, it seemed like magic how websites were created. My search for understanding how websites are built resulted in a graduate degree in computer science.",
      "par2": "Although I have backend experience, frontend it really where I feel at home. It is the area where ideas come alive."
    },
    "section3": {
      "par1": "Coming from a combined background of both development and design, it is difficult to choose just one area to focus on. Both disciplines allow me to exercise completely different skills and work processes.",
      "par2": "If I want to work alone and really focus, bring out with the keyboard! If I want cooperation, brainstorming and interactive processes? UX is amazing.",
      "par3": "If I want to get down to the nitty gritty with implementation details? Back to the keyboard. If I, however, feel like working more visually and creatively? Back to the users and other designers.",
      "par4": "Switching between these disciplines and valuing the strength of both, is what I believe constitutes a UX engineer. It is someone who really works in the intersection between design and development, and it is were I see myself."

My interests range from languages to teaching to Norwegian national costume embroidery to sewing to programming. I am a creative person and programming is yet another area in which I can exercise my creativity. As oppsosed to making clothes, the practical thing about coding projects is that they do not demand space in a cupboard.",
      "par2": "I am happy when I can alter between working alone and collaborating with others, and I am passionate about the human aspect of IT. I would label myself as a UX engineer as I have great interst, and education, in both UX and software development. Even within the field of computer science, I have an interdisciplinary approach.",

      "par4": "Naturally, this affects my daily life and I value family greatly. I am very interested in areas related to children, and the combination of teaching and programming. In fact, a teaching degree is the only education I have started which I have yet to complete."

However, when tweaking the «tail» I realized that they normally face the other way, and was about to change them to conform with traditional UI components.",

I’m all for not changing what works and am aware of the dangers from getting creative with things people expect to work and certain way. BUT, if I can't get away with displaying a few personal quirks on my own website, then where?"
